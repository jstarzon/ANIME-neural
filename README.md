# ANIME-neural
just quick test of my neural network analyzer

Change this value in Anime-neural.py
num_epochs = 100
Higher value, better result. This value changes how much iterations training model does through dataset.

## What it does
- Load pictures
- Train model
- Saves trained model into .h5 file
- Saves generater pictures into a folder
- Saves telemetry for each epoch in .csv file

You can put any pictures you want but I decided to put every anime character that exist. 
Thats why I named it ANIME-Neural-Network :)


Thanks for help with debugging Anime-neural.py [@Mitkins1](https://github.com/Mitkins1) :)
