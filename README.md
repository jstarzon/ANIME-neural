# ANIME-neural
just quick test of my neural network analyzer

What this script does:
1.Load pictures into memory
2.Train model with those pictures
3.Save the model into .h5 file

You can put any pictures you want but I decided to put every anime character that exist. 
Thats why I named it ANIME-Neural-Network :)


Thanks for help with debuging [@Mitkins1](https://github.com/Mitkins1) :)
