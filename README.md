# ANIME-GAN NEURAL NETWORK
just quick test of my neural network 

Change this value in Anime-neural.py
num_epochs = 100
Higher value, better result. This value changes how much iterations training model does through dataset.


Work in progress...

## What it does
- Load pictures dataset
- Train model 
- Saves trained model into .h5 file
- Saves generated pictures into a folder
- Saves telemetry for each epoch in .csv file
- Resume training

You can put any dataset to train. I decided to use anime pictures.
