# ANIME-neural
just quick test of my neural network analyzer

## What it does
- Load pictures
- Train model
- Saves trained model into .h5 file

You can put any pictures you want but I decided to put every anime character that exist. 
Thats why I named it ANIME-Neural-Network :)


Thanks for help with debugging Anime-neural.py [@Mitkins1](https://github.com/Mitkins1) :)
