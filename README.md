# ANIME-GAN NEURAL NETWORK
just quick test of my neural network 

Change this value in Anime-neural.py
num_epochs = 100
Higher value, better result. This value changes how much iterations training model does through dataset.


Work in progress...

## What it does
- Load pictures dataset
- Train model 
- Saves trained model into .h5 file
- Saves generater pictures into a folder
- Saves telemetry for each epoch in .csv file
- Resume training

You can put any pictures you want but I decided to put every anime character that exist. 
Thats why I named it ANIME-Neural-Network :)
